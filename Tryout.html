                <p class="p1">Hey how are you I'm Ali, and this is a blog about my life in the forest.
                    Living in the forest as a professional is a wild ride, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
                    Every morning, I wake up to birds singing and the smell of pine, with trees as far as the eye can see.
                    My “office” is the great outdoors—endless trails, towering trees, and the occasional curious deer. 
                    I’m responsible for keeping this place in balance, whether I’m tracking wildlife, checking the health of the ecosystem, or making sure humans aren’t messing things up too much.
                    It’s a job that demands patience and a serious connection to nature.
                    Most days, I’m out there with my gear—GPS in hand, a notebook tucked in my pack, and maybe a portable lab kit if it’s a research day.
                    Sometimes I’ll be deep in the woods for hours, following animal tracks or collecting water samples. The forest constantly surprises me.
                    I’ve picked up all sorts of random skills, like reading the weather just by feeling the wind or recognizing animal prints.
                    Every day is a lesson in survival and respect for the natural world.
                    A few weeks ago, I had one of those days where the forest just throws something wild at you.
                    I was tracking a family of deer when I noticed fresh bear tracks—not a huge deal, but enough to get my attention.
                    I decided to follow them for a bit, curiosity taking over. I ended up near a stream, and there, not 20 feet away, was a massive black bear, casually fishing.
                    It glanced at me, completely uninterested, then went back to catching its lunch.
                    It was one of those rare moments where I felt like a complete outsider in nature’s world—like I was the one being watched.
                    Moments like that keep me humble, reminding me just how vast and unpredictable this life is.                    
                    That said, it’s not all serene moments under the trees.
                    Isolation can be tough, and the weather can be brutal—one minute you’re sweating through your shirt, the next you’re freezing your toes off.
                    But the quiet moments make it all worth it.
                    When the sunlight filters through the leaves just right, or I catch sight of a deer wandering by, it reminds me why I’m out here.
                    This lifestyle isn’t for everyone, but for me, there’s no better feeling than knowing I’m doing my part to protect this incredible place and help it thrive for future generations.
